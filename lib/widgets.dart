/// There are three types of widgets in this library:

/// 
/// 2. Atomic widgets: widgets that represent a single piece of data, (something
/// from the `data` library) with a canonic form all around the app. These 
/// widgets usually have `InfoTile` (defined here) as a base. 
/// 
/// 4. Ambient widgets: Inherited widgets that can be accessed anywhere 
/// in the app using `BuildContext`s.
